# Pitch Narrative

## The Vision

Every SMB deserves an AI analyst that remembers everything about their operations and gets smarter with every conversation. We are building the "Brain" of the modern effortless enterprise.

## The Problem

Operations teams at SMBs (50-500 employees) are the glue holding the company together, but they are breaking.

- **Fragmented Truth**: Data lives in 50+ SaaS tools, PDFs, and local Excel sheets.
- **Resource Constrained**: A dedicated BizOps analyst costs $100K–$150K/year — often out of reach.
- **Knowledge Leak**: When the Ops Manager leaves, years of institutional context walks out the door.
- **Reactive Firefighting**: Teams spend 80% of time searching for info, 20% fixing problems, and 0% optimizing.

## Our Solution: OpsOrchestra

An AI-powered Business Operations Analyst that provides **Fortune 500 intelligence at SMB prices**.

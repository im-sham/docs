# Analytics & ROI

OpsOrchestra includes built-in analytics capabilities for tracking KPIs and calculating vendor ROI.

## KPI Tracking

The KPI module (`app/kpi/`) provides automated metric extraction from your documents.

### Capabilities

- **Metric Extraction**: LLM-assisted extraction of numerical KPIs from PDFs and spreadsheets
- **Trend Identification**: Statistical regression to detect increasing/decreasing/stable patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: Z-score thresholding to flag unusual values

### Data Models

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `KPIMetric` | Single data point (name, value, unit, period, source) |
| `KPITimeSeries` | Collection of metrics over time |
| `TrendResult` | Analysis output (direction, growth rate, confidence) |
| `Anomaly` | Flagged outlier with deviation score |

### Example Usage

Ask the agent questions like:
- "What was our revenue trend last quarter?"
- "Are there any anomalies in our monthly expenses?"
- "Show me all metrics from the Q3 report"

## ROI Analysis

The ROI module (`app/roi/`) helps analyze vendor spend and calculate return on investment.

### Capabilities

- **Vendor Spend Tracking**: Aggregate costs by vendor, category, and period
- **Value Metric Capture**: Track hours saved, revenue generated, etc.
- **ROI Calculation**: Net value, ROI percentage, payback period
- **Recommendations**: Actionable advice (RETAIN, REVIEW, CANCEL)

### Data Models

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `VendorSpend` | Cost entry (vendor, amount, currency, period) |
| `ValueMetric` | Benefit entry (type, value, unit) |
| `ROIResult` | Calculated ROI (spend, value, net, percentage) |
| `Recommendation` | Action advice with rationale |

### Example Usage

Ask the agent questions like:
- "What's the ROI on Slack?"
- "Which tools should we consider canceling?"
- "Show me our top 5 vendors by spend"

## Demo Data
